    o "Oh? The mining exports are of low-quality? That's unfortunate, isn't it?"

    o "The reality of the situation is, that ore is still the greatest quality available. We can't exactly mine pure steel out of the ground. The vein gives eventually."

    o "No. No, there is nothing to talk about here. Neither I nor the Queen have the agency to change the simple fact that there is not enough. I propose that you simply go back to her, and let her be a bit sad for a bit. I'm certain she'll get over it."

    o "If you can't handle that, I *can* offer a work around."
    ### Devious scheme
    o "Herzog's territory is relatively rich in mineral wealth. However, the fool has declined every opportunity to exploit it. I propose this:"

    "Olm procures a small sphere, split in two halves, and rolls it to you."

    o "This is a 'dowsing' drone. All you have to do is spin the two halves against each other to activate it in Herzog's territory. It will do the rest."

    o "If you can do this for me, I can promise the Queen that the ores she receives will be of renewed high quality within the next two weeks."

            o "You are dreaming. Please wake up."
        "Screw you, you blind worm.":
            "blah"
        "I give up.":
            "blah"
