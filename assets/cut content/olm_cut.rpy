        It was a standard Tuesday when the Change happened.

        In Retrospect it should have been expected. Due to near-constant support, Baron Olm advanced technology rapidly. Each invention changed everyone’s way of life; from preference-bound AI to room-temperature superconductors. 

        However, none could be compared to the Dream Lucidifier, a device shaped like a conch’s shell that would broadcast the Secret to alter reality to one’s whims to everyone in the Kingdom.

        There was instant chaos. With the complete elimination of Scarcity, Power and Government soon disintegrated. Even the concept of Society became blurred. Soon, people discovered the ability to alter themselves, and with that Self, Soul, Identity, Reality, and Fiction became footnotes in the history books. 

        Of course, it wasn’t all destructive. New concepts replaced the Old- H’yfghįæ and Chjpøÿ‰ became especially prevalent -but the Old World would forever be Forgotten. 

        And everyone agreed that that would be a good thing. Sure it was sad to see it go, but it is the nature of Time and Betterment to see once the Omnipresent fall into Dust. It was as if the Universe grew up.

        Some time after the Change, a group that might have once dreamed of being Baron Olm met. They felt the need to sing one last song, even though they knew that it was nonsense. So, throughout what was once the Kingdom, all who could hear (and some who couldn’t) hummed along to this tune:

        ¡01010100 01001011!

        ¿01001101 01001001?

        . . .01011010 . . .

        In Retrospect, it was obvious what the fate of Baron Olm’s ideas would be. He tried his hardest in his long life to advance Knowledge and find Truth, and it was obvious to everyone at the time that his ideals would lead to greatness.

        On his deathbed, the wise Baron had his chief advisor transcribe his last words into the bedrock of the electronic communications network that he had spent decades making. He said the following:

        “I know that my work probably won’t matter much in the grand scheme of things. If I hadn’t built this network, someone else would have. But, even though my Role was small, I enjoyed doing it. The world is cruel and indifferent, but there’s always hope on the horizon. Never give up, because no matter what our collective Intellect and Ambition will find a way forward. No matter how small you are, you can make a difference.”

        “Ha, maybe I’m growing sentimental in my age but I feel like giving this fundamental Truth that Hope always triumphs over Despair a name. Maybe the Law of Cycles? No, that’s a terrible name for it. Well, it’s not like it needs a good name anyway. But at least it needs to make some sense.”

        “Well, I guess I’ll leave the naming of this concept to future generations.”

        And so Olm’s last thoughts were broadcast for everyone to see. They were even carved into the stone of his Manor and written into the beginnings of textbooks. 

        “He may have had little self-esteem,” everyone said to themselves, “but he will surely be remembered for all time. We will make sure of it.”

        Five years later, all the books had been burnt. Olm’s network lay in shambles. Soon, the light of Civilization went out and all trace of Sentience in the Universe vanished, never to be seen again.

        As the stars went out one by one, there was no one to even forget that Baron Olm ever existed.

        Suddenly, you hear the sound of a soul shattering.

        You look around. You try to say something, but you find that you never learned to speak. You try to find your friends, but find that you never made any.

        You have always been alone.

        Reality shifts, white arms grip and tear. You see a long, pale figure with a golden gear-shaped halo. He looks at you, then screams a sound halfway between joyous laughter and unrelenting sobbing.

        Then the world had always been eaten forever.

        . . .

        After an instant eternity, you realise that you should have been nicer to Baron Olm.
