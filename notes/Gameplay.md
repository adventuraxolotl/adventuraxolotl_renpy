## Core Loop
1. The core gameplay loop will initially consist of unlocking more characters to talk with - we start out with an introduction from Queen Axolotl, who sends us on a mission to one or more of the other characters, so on until we have access to the entire net, with the notable exception of Prince Axolotl (who won't be seen in most games, and is only unlocked through Queen Axolotl's storyline), as well as possibly Marquis Mudskipper, depending on how your relationship with the Wobbegong develops.
2. Once you have access to the core cast of characters, characters gain new dialogue options, and the meat of the gameplay begins. Your relationship with each character gets assigned an integer value (Paradox games-style), and will augment or decrease with the character's trust or respect for you. Unlike in Paradox games, though, this value will be kept a secret (unless you acquire a special item that allows you to view it??? to develop). The amount of different story trees at this point will become impossible to map, meaning it will have to be extensively playtested for balance and fun.
3. The final act can be triggered by branching into one of the pre-established ending Scenarios, which all fire off if certain story conditions are met. Each Scenario can lead to at least two Endings, depending on the player's actions within it. Some ideas include Queen Axolotl's secret about her son's metamorphosis, Herzog Bullfrog seceding from the Kingdom and taking any characters you can't convert in time with him, thus ushering either in the Axolotl Kingdom's fall, or rebirth as a much more stricter and centralised authoritarian empire, as well as the Toad Council succeeding in some ritual or other (which we've established is nicer and more helpful than one would think)
## Preferences & Affection
I guess each character has different actions that they “like” and “dislike,” each adding various amounts to the Affection Meter

I’m not sure what the official term for these preferences are, so let’s just call them preference-specifications (pref-specs). 

The pref-specs wouldn’t be visible unless you got the Olm to develop pref-spec calculation technology.
## Shops

The Baron is the tech guy because of the reference to the semiconductor industry in the video

So I guess there’s at least two different “Shop” characters.

Don can give you rumours and you can hire hit/spy squads from him.

Baron turns into a shop when you have high enough affection. You can buy various game-altering technologies only when he thinks that you are worthy of them.

However, buying items and bribes don’t actually work on these two to increase Affection. This is because they bribe people often, even the player, so they know what’s up. The real way to become friends with Don is by convincing him that you care about him even though he’s a fish. For the Baron, it’s listening to his nerdy ramblings and getting excited with him.
### Items and Gifts
The player will be able to hold onto items, and give them to various characters, or use them in some other way. They can be bought, found, or given.
### Currency
The player will be given a salary every year. This is intended for use for personal use. The scale of each piece of currency is large - It's quite lucrative.
Say that the player gets paid 10 "coins". And let's say that each coin is more or less half a year's pay for a normal person.
#idea - invest in a business?
### The Calendar
At some cycle length (every month?), the [[Diet]] will convene and discuss/vote on a measure or reform.

**Committees & Recurring Events**
- The player can sign up to do certain things, such as be on committees etc. This can be a regular expectation. For the coming year (or multiple), the player will be expected to attend once per season, so early/mid/late.

Month -> Season -> Year.
Diets occur every year. 
Player selects an activity every month.
Seasons can affect some activities, e.g.
- Player may be able to participate in harvests or harvest festivals.

Player activities affects:
- The world state. e.g. prosperity of a nation
- Relationship with characters
- Player stats
### Locations 
Each day/week the player will choose one activity. Some conversations are time-taking, others are not. There should be a way to spend time with characters without triggering a conversation.

e.g., learn psychology with the queen. Practice swordfighting with peeper. Play chess with herzog. That kind of thing.

At each location there may be multiple characters, or activities that aren't talking to characters. The player will be able to choose what to do, or who to talk to, once arrived at a location.

Main locations:
**Ambystoma Kingdom**
	Axolotl
	Sometimes Newt
	Commander Salamander
**Anura Duchy**, 
	Herzog Frog
	Toad Council
	Spring Peeper
**Proteus Fiefdom**.
	Olm
	Sometimes Newt
	Don Lungfish
#### Home
There may be a player home. Somewhere near axolotl. Just somewhere to end days on.
