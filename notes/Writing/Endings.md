Think **Fire Emblem: Three Houses**.
Each character with an ending has an ideological basis, and an ideal world that they want to see. Each character also believes that every other ending kind of sucks, to various degrees.

Potential states that lissamphibia can be at the end of the game:
- Vassal to Fish Empire
- Destroyed. Turned to Dust.
- Technological Singularity - Baron Olm
- Religious Singularity
- Reform of the Head of State: 
	- Military Coup by Commander Salamander.
	- Election of a president or monarch:
		- Queen Axolotl stays
		- Election of other
- Reform of the [[Diet]]: 
	- Reduced representatives
	- Plus elected representatives
	- Elected representatives only
- Capitalism wins - full industry.
	- Climate change end
	- Sustainable end
- Full revolution
	- Good: Supported by player - uneasy peace end?
	- Bad: Not supported by player. Too much tradition. Napolenic wars / invasion end

I suppose one ending could be when Baron Olm gets so much support (aka Affection) that he ushers the world into a technological renaissance.

The reason why the game would “end” is because the technologies (AGI, Mind Uploading, Cybernetics, etc) would cause so many changes so rapidly that even if we tried to program them in, the game would be unplayable.

“Everyone got the ability to change themselves, the ability to be truly dedicated to themselves and others. This resulted in chaos, but the chaos of turning from a tadpole into a frog. In retrospect it was necessary, but the end of an era is always sorrowful. This new world will not be a utopia nor a dystopia, but it will be radically different. The details, however, will forever be beyond our reach.”

Ok, I’m going to start rating hypothetical endings from Good to Bad: (note that these endings aren’t mutually exclusive.

Good: The Queen gets her son treated without the eldritch ritual thing. This might require tech from the Baron.

The “True” Ending. The Frog Council completes their Dark Ritual and turns the kingdom into a Democracy. (Edit: This is the ending that leads to the sequel game that we will probably never make)

Bittersweet: Baron Olm’s Technological Singularity Thing.

Bad: The Civil War/Succession.

The entire Kingdom being sacrificed in an eldritch ritual so that the Queen can save her son

HeroKP: The alternative, of course, being crushing Olm and his puny trinkets and ushering in a Golden Dark Age
