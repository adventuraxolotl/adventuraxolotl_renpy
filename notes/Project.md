# The Project
This project is a fan-made version of Adventuraxolotl, as shown in Oliver Lugg’s video [Adventuraxolotl: Lord of Amphibians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHqxiLckqIw). First step is the \#adventuraxolotl channel in the Luggnuts discord server here: [https://discord.gg/AVcU9w5gVW](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0lCWjB1aUZEVjI5WUZ6UlhPUnd1MnFGTHV4Z3xBQ3Jtc0tsb0Z1ZlZzdHNlY21yOFdMNHd6SWIzS1l5SzRDTzYxTVo2QnNyelNJeWk4elJiV2syZjZFQXd5QjQyZGQ4TlNXV0RORDdHRjFzd1Y2b3M1cExNbGtDSjMzYWhvWF9vaFUwSzdNWjEzV2dfcTlMalp0MA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FAVcU9w5gVW&v=KHqxiLckqIw).

Project Vision: to realise the game as presented in the video.
## Constraints
- No AI-generated assets. Oliver Lugg has stated ethical disagreements.
- No involvement of money. Money makes things… weird. All work and assets should be contributed on a volunteer basis only.
- No Tim Tam.
## Development
Codebase: [https://github.com/Tychology/Adventuraxolotl](https://github.com/Tychology/Adventuraxolotl). This codebase uses godot and GDScript, primarily.

We should use a github project to manage stuff. It’s probably the best way to go about things.

# Goal 1: Vertical Slice/Minimum Viable Product

- Constrain development to only what a demo might contain; which would be a vertical slice of the game.
- Can then be published on itch.io, to garner further interest.
- Reduces amount of content that will have to be planned for and created, such that what is made will actually see the light of day.
- Should end at somewhat of a cliffhanger. Could be the end of Act 1 or some such. Should include only two endings.
