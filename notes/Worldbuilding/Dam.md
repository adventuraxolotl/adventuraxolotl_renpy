Really just **an engineering project** which **allows amphibians to live everywhere**.
- A Dam is very engineery, and very fallout new vegas. Hoover dam, anyone?
- Could just be irrigation channels, constructed wetland stuff. Less central, less ability to destroy and stuff

Terrestrial toads and frogs don't like it that much. Fishes don't like it at all.
Most amphibians agree it's pretty important for their way of life, though.
