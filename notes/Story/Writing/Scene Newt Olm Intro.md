*Conclusion:* You both arrive at Olm's lair. You individually do negotiations over something.

## Newt Intro

"The Queen gives you directions to the OIm's home. It's quite a distance away from anything else."

"Eventually you arrive at what you think is the right spot. There's absolutely nothing around, though."

n "You there! I haven't seen you around before. How do you do?"

n "Anyway, now with pleasantries out of the way, you look like the sort of chap #todo that looks like they want to see Baron Olm. Would that be right?"

n "I thought so. Well, come along with me now, I'll get you there in one piece."

"Countess Newt tromps through the swamp, eventually reaching a pier with a small rowboat."

"Newt gets into the front of the boat."

n "Hop to it now! I haven't got all day! I'll navigate, you drive."

n "I found this rowboat, and have just been looking around for someone to row it! Now you've come along, so you're a perfect fit."

"Newt navigates through the mangrove and into a cave. At the end of the long tunnel, you reach a dry landing, with a built stone wall and a solid wooden door."

"Newt disembarks and knocks on the door."

n "Hello? Olmyy!"

n "No response. No problem, I have a spare key."

"Newt opens the door."

n "Come, come, warm yourself in the living room. Olm isn't the biggest one for niceties, but I absolutely *insisted* that he install a fireplace. Firewood's over there, here's a poker. Enjoy!"

"Before you get the chance to interrupt, Newt practically flies across the room. She knocks on another door, and opens it. Just before entering, she turns back to you:"

n "I'll be quick, Darl. I'll let Olm know you're waiting."
