*Context:* You are on your way to [[Baron Olm]] to do his intro. You're lost, and you meet [[Countess Newt]], who is also on her way to meet Olm. You and her team up to get into his lair, which isn't the easiest to get to.

*Conclusion:* You both arrive at Olm's lair. You individually do negotiations over something.

*Information being withheld:* Olm and Newt have a deal; that the higher quality ore will go to Newt and the [[Pleurodelinae Plutocracy]] instead of the Queen. Why? Idk.
## Newt Intro

"The Queen gives you directions to the OIm's home. It's quite a distance away from anything else."

"Eventually you arrive at what you think is the right spot. There's absolutely nothing around, though."

n "You there! I haven't seen you around before. How do you do?"

n "Anyway, now with pleasantries out of the way, you look like the sort of chap #todo that looks like they want to see Baron Olm. Would that be right?"

n "I thought so. Well, come along with me now, I'll get you there in one piece."

"Countess Newt tromps through the swamp, eventually reaching a pier with a small rowboat."

"Newt gets into the front of the boat."

n "Hop to it now! I haven't got all day! I'll navigate, you drive."

n "I found this rowboat, and have just been looking around for someone to row it! Now you've come along, so you're a perfect fit."

"Newt navigates through the mangrove and into a cave. At the end of the long tunnel, you reach a dry landing, with a built stone wall and a solid wooden door."

"Newt disembarks and knocks on the door."

n "Hello? Olmyy!"

n "No response. No problem, I have a spare key."

"Newt opens the door."

n "Come, come, warm yourself in the living room. Olm isn't the biggest one for niceties, but I absolutely *insisted* that he install a fireplace. Firewood's over there, here's a poker. Enjoy!"

"Before you get the chance to interrupt, Newt practically flies across the room. She knocks on another door, and opens it. Just before entering, she turns back to you:"

n "I'll be quick, Darl. I'll let Olm know you're waiting."
## Olm Intro
"Newt exits the chamber, and waves you in."

"It's dark. Your eyes adjust to the cave."

o "Hello."

o "Now, why is an outsider to the kingdom inside my innermost chamber...?"

o "Yes, yes. Newt let you in. I don't know why she did that. But please, make it quick. I have many more important things to tend to than... whatever this is."

"Olm vaguely gestures in your direction."

o "Oh? The mining exports are of low-quality? That's unfortunate, isn't it?"

o "The reality of the situation is, that ore is still the greatest quality available. We can't exactly mine pure steel out of the ground. The vein gives eventually."

o "No. No, there is nothing to talk about here. Neither I nor the Queen have the agency to change the simple fact that there is not enough. I propose that you simply go back to her, and let her be a bit sad for a bit. I'm certain she'll get over it."

o "If you can't handle that, I *can* offer a work around."
### Devious scheme
o "Herzog's territory is relatively rich in mineral wealth. However, the fool has declined every opportunity to exploit it. I propose this:"

"Olm procures a small sphere, split in two halves, and rolls it to you."

o "This is a 'dowsing' drone. All you have to do is spin the two halves against each other to activate it in Herzog's territory. It will do the rest."

o "If you can do this for me, I can promise the Queen that the ores she receives will be of renewed high quality within the next two weeks."
