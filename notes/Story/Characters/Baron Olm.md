Lives in a cave. Uses drones to mine stuff.

A trickster and plotter. Just wants to do his science stuff but needs stuff from the outside world to do it. Almost never clear with his intent.

[[Countess Newt]] is kind of a cross between an overbearing landlord and a manic pixie dream girl for him. Is often the only real person he sees most weeks.

Will warm up to the player with repeated visits. Ideally, the visits are on a repeatable schedule, not too far apart, but also not too close together. Even more ideally, you bring something that you both can do together.
### Scene Idea
At some point after getting to know olm, he asks you how he should romantically approach newt. This is particularly awkward if either is your romantic interest lmao
