For the first half (ish) of the game, the major loop will be around the Diet and whatever happens there. There will be reforms, committees, and votes.

All major characters will attend the diet, precluding minor characters such as [[Squire Spring Peeper]], who does not have a fiefdom or organization to represent.

The typical voting bloc is Olm-Newt, Toads-Anura, with Axolotl as a breaking tie. Usually this means that the player has a good amount of influence over where the vote lands.

**On occasion**, there will be an Axolotl-Other bloc; with the other three against. In these situations, the player will be asked to convince one of the other three.
