## Theme

Narotiza: 
>in the dream the game was incredibly complex and perhaps a bit dark below the simple surface,  not as a ddlc-style bait and switch meant to shock the player but i guess more like a rabbit hole of more and more stuff the player uncovers? i don't remember what the secret was specifically but a lot of the discussions revolved around figuring out the best solution to a very difficult ethical problem

>all the political intrigue and diplomacy is only scratching the surface

>also idk if i'll do any more art but i suppose you're free to adapt my existing art and make changes n stuff, with credit of course
