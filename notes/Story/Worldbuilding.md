## Worldbuilding

Lissamphibia exists in a swampy, warm, forested environment. There is an artificial dam creating this habitat. Many species of amphibian, along with some species of amphibious fish live in this region. It is governed by a Holy Roman Empire Expy, headed by Queen Axolotl of the Kingdom of Ambytoma. Technically The Great Council is the mechanism of governance, but since the Dam was built by the Axolotls, real power is in them. There is some industrialization occurring, primarily in the Kingdom of Ambytoma, headed by Countess Newt of the Plutocracy.

The oceanic border is hotly contested by The Fish Empire, specifically Marquis Mudskipper. All other borders are mountainous, and guarded by the Anura and the federal army collectively. The Family is an organised network that controls the river running through the territory.
