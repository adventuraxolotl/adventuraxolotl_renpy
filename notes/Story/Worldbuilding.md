## Lissamphibia
Lissamphibia exists in a swampy, warm, forested environment. There is an artificial dam creating this habitat. Many species of amphibian, along with some species of amphibious fish live in this region. 

It is governed by a Holy Roman Empire Expy, headed by [[Queen Axolotl]] of the Kingdom of Ambytoma. 

Technically the [[Diet]] is the mechanism of governance, but since the [[Dam]] was built by the Axolotls, real power is in them. 

There is some [[Technology|industrialization]] occurring, primarily in the Kingdom of Ambytoma, headed by Countess Newt of the Plutocracy.

The oceanic border is hotly contested by The Fish Empire, specifically [[Marquis Mudskipper]]. All other borders are mountainous, and guarded by [[Herzog Frog|the Anura]] and the [[Commander Salamander|federal army]] collectively.
