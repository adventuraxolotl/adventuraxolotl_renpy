Wise and friendly. Always willing to help.

Queen Axolotl is a bit of a... people pleaser. She's steadily unsure about her footing, and wants to make sure that everyone is happy. She's risk-adverse and indecisive.

What this means is that the main character may have to act somewhat covertly from her oversight, in order to produce better outcomes for people.

She's a pacifist.

A trained psychologist.
